1. What are the Security Groups and Network ACLs, and how do they differ?
Answer: Security Groups:
-> Acts as a firewall for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
-> stateful:- Return traffic automatically allowed, regardless of rules.
Network ACLs ( Access control Lists):
-> Acts as a firewall for associated subnets, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
-> stateless:- Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules.
